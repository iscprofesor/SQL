Existen algunas reglas que deben seguir las subconsultas:

Las subconsultas tienen que estar dentro de parÃ©ntesis

Una subconsulta puede tener una sola columna especificada en la clÃ¡usula SELECT. Si quieres que una subconsulta compare varias columnas, esas columnas deben haberse seleccionado en la consulta principal.

Las subconsultas que devuelven mÃ¡s de una fila solo pueden usarse con mÃºltiples operadores de valor, tales como el operador IN que permite especificar mÃºltiples valores en una clÃ¡usula WHERE.

Una subconsulta no puede estar anidada en un comando SET. El comando SET se usa con UPDATE para especificar quÃ© columnas (y valores) se deben actualizar en una tabla.
